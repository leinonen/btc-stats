            <h2 class="title">Blocks (BTC only)</h2>

            <p>New bitcoins are created as part of bitcoin blocks. The blocks are built on top of each other in a chain. This page shows the blocks generated at BitMinter. If someone else builds a block at the same height as us, one of the blocks (theirs or ours) will become orphaned and yield no coins. If the block is orphaned upon creation it will be listed as stale. This can happen if a proof of work for creating a block is submitted too late, after we have already started building at the next height.</p>

            <h2 class="title">Shift history</h2>

            <p>Work is measured in proofs of work. Each proof of work is given a score equal to one divided by the
                difficulty at the time it was submitted. Proofs of work are grouped in shifts. A shift is completed
                when its total score passes 0.1. Whenever new coins are minted, they are divided between
                contributing members proportionally to the total score each member has within the last 10 completed
                shifts.</p>
